To Make changes to this site

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

If you want to make changes to the Backend processing part of the Site, simply Go to folder "Js" in the root directory and make changes to "Data-compile.js" file

Here's how everything works,

Whenever a person fills the Google form and clicks on submit, it creates a new entry on a google spreadsheet.

This spreadsheet is read and parsed by a JavaScript package called "RGraph"

Once we have data from the spreadsheet, it is read, and parsed,

this parsed information is then presented through HTML cards.
